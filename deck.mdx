# Javascript testing

# Testing ROI

<Image src="testing-roi.png" size="800px" width="800px" height="600px" />

---

# Write tests.
# Not too many.
# Mostly integration.

Don't TDD everything. Don't mock too much. Don't strive for 100% coverage.

---

# General Principles

* Mocking too much reduces test quality.
* More isolation results in less bug caught.
* Using real data or mocking is ok, but you should not use both in single test.
* Each test case must not depend on each other.

---

# What makes a good test

* Runs fast.
* Does not break often.
* Easy to read & understand.
* Catches bug.
* Good coverage to effort ratio.

---

# It takes a few iterations

---

# Once you found a good test strategy. Share it.
###### or at least write it down in Confluence.

---

# Testing worksheet

1. What would be the worst part to break.
2. What are the untested parts related to this functionality.
3. How do Users or System interact with this part.
4. Repeat.

---

# Keep tests clean

* Shared test utilities.
* Generation of test templates.
* Lint rules & documentation.
